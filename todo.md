- [x] find and fix all bugs in the worktree-tui tool, the migration to using gix was complex, ensure all features are working properly and as expected, you can use the fity-worktrees/ repo for testing, in a tmux session you can probably even use the change dir feature as they are self contained sessions.
- [x] bring over small QoL changes from main to this gix branch
- [ ] implement a diff feature to compare worktrees and commits, use delta as source to incorporate
