i think its actually a better idea to be able to choose which branch to merge back the changes. 
we're gonna need some settings anyways so thats maybe a good time to introduce them. we need settings for the default branch to merge the changes and for a prefix that the new branches will have when the user creates one.

maybe a diff mode? using difftastic or critique

deleted worktrees leave behind the branches...

also just add commit feature?

maybe changes counter next to commits

layout should be 50/50

the details panels content should be cleaner, its to chaotic right now, please analyze it and find an optimal solution

new layout? move the details panel below the table, and the right panel is a diff viewer, maybe like in conductor?
